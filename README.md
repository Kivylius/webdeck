# ðŸ”³ Webdeck

Configure your deck using only the web browser. Install plugins, explore custom configurations, presets and profiles.

## Getting started

Visit http://webdeck.org to get started.

## Plugins

All public plugins can be found under [`webdeck-plugin`](https://github.com/search?q=topic:webdeck-plugin) topic, in github. Just paste the url of the repo into webdeck and you're ready to go.

## Drivers

We are planning to add driver support for other devices other than the Stream Deck. Consider following this repo and make a [discussion](https://github.com/webdeckjs/webdeck/discussions) on what devices we should support. The plan is to allow drivers to be just like the plugins, made by anyone, for maximum compatibility.
