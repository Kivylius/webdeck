## Plugins

Plugins are the heart and soul of Webdeck, anyone can create them and the resource bellow will guide you on you journey.

## Drivers

We are planning to add driver support for other devices other than the Stream Deck. Consider following this repo and make a [discussion](https://github.com/webdeckjs/webdeck/discussions) on what devices we should support. The plan is to allow drivers to be just like the plugins, made by anyone, for maximum compatibility.
